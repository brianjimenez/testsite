## Description

HADDOCK v3.0 is a bottom-up reimagination of the long standing time-proven [HADDOCK](/software/haddock2.2) used for integrative modeling of biomolecular complexes.
This young and still very experimental (use it at your own risk!) aims to modularize and extend HADDOCK's core functions.

In its current implementation, HADDOCK v3.0 still lacks the full repertoire of features present at the production web server version, [HADDOCK v2.4](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/).
However it is able to take full advantage of the ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process.

It was evaluated using the [Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark 5](https://github.com/haddocking/BM5-clean) and compared with the live version (v2.4).
This evaluation was done using the true interface of each complex of (3.9 Å) and is expressed in terms of success rate; the amount of BM5 targets that have at least one docking solution below the specified threshold within a specified subset of solutions ranked by HADDOCK-score.
