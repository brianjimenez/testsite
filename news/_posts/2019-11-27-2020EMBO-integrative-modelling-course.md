Registration is open for the third edition of our EMBO practical course on Integrative Modelling of Biomolecular Complexes. It will take place Mayt 10-15, 2020 in Izmir, Turkey.

This course will present docking-based computational methods and related bioinformatics approaches, aiming at predicting how proteins interact with other biomolecules or ligands. Lectures will provide the theoretical background on state-of-the-art algorithms for sampling and scoring docking models, describe the use of low- and high-resolution information, and conservation- and coevolution-based interface prediction methods. Roughly half of the course wil consist of practical sessions where the students will run computations on interesting biological problems.
