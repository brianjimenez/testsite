In this page you can find links to tutorials on the usage of our software and webportal [HADDOCK 2.4](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/).

* [**HADDOCK2.4 local installation tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-local-tutorial):
  A tutorial demonstrating the installation and use of a local installation of HADDOCK2.4. It demonstrates various docking scenarios.
  You will need for this a valid license of HADDOCK2.4.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 basic protein-protein docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-protein-protein-basic):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of the HADDOCK web server to model a protein-protein complex using interface information derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation data.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 MS cross-links tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-Xlinks):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of cross-linking data from mass spectrometry to guide the docking in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial builds on our [DisVis tutorial](/education/Others/disvis-webserver/) and illustrates various scenarios of using
  cross-linking data in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**DISVIS/HADDOCK2.4 oligomer puzzle**](/education/HADDOCK24/XL-MS-oligomer):
  In this tutorial you will have to solve an oligomer puzzle, namely predicting the correct oligomeric state
  of a symmetrical homomer complex based on a few (artificial) cross-links.
  The tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of the DISVIS and HADDOCK web servers and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 CA-CA restraints guided docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-CACA-guided):
  A tutorial demonstrating a template-based approach to model protein-protein complexes. It combines the PS-HomPPI web server to find suitable templates and generate CA-CA distance restraints and HADDOCK for the CA-CA guided modelling.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of the PS-HomPPI and HADDOCK web servers and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 ab-initio, multi-body symmetrical docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-CASP-CAPRI-T70):
  A tutorial demonstrating multi-body docking with HADDOCK using its ab-initio mode with symmetry restraints.
  It is based on a former CASP-CAPRI target (T70).

* [**HADDOCK2.4 ligand binding site tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-binding-sites):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of HADDOCK in ab-initio mode to screen for potential ligand binding sites.
  The information from the ab-initio run is then used to setup a binding pocket-targeted protein-ligand docking run.
  We use as example the multidrug exporter AcrB.
