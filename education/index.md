## Courses

* [**NMR & Molecular Modelling**](/education/NMRMolmod/): A bachelor course dealing with both NMR and modelling. This link will bring you the computer practical for this course in which you will be modelling a protein-protein complex based on NMR chemical shift data.

* [**Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling**](/education/molmod/): A MSc course aimed at those interested in learning homology modelling, molecular simulation, and docking of biological molecules. All the material is freely available on our Github repository and makes use of Vagrant/Virtualbox.


## Research projects

We offer various [research projects](/education/research-projects/) to both bachelor and master students, all centered around our main research area: the development of reliable bioinformatics and computational approaches to predict, model and dissect biomolecular interactions at atomic level.

## Tutorials

* [**Tutorials for HADDOCK version 2.4**](/education/HADDOCK24): Various tutorials from basic protein-protein docking, to the use of cross-linking data, symmetry and homology informations to guide the docking, and advanced modelling of protein-ligand complexes.

* [**Tutorials for HADDOCK version 2.2**](/education/HADDOCK):  Various tutorials from basic protein-protein docking, to the use of cross-linking data, symmetry and homology informations to guide the docking, and advanced modelling of protein-ligand complexes.

* [**Tutorials for DisVis and Powerfit**](/education/Others): Tutorials about rigid-body fitting into cryo-EM maps and assessing the information content of cross-linking data.

* [**Integrative modelling of the RNA polymerase III apo complex**](/education/HADDOCK24/RNA-Pol-III): A combination of our DISVIS, POWERFIT and HADDOCK2.4 portals using cross-links and cryo-EM data to model a large macromolecular assembly.
